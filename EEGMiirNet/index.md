# Convolutional Neural Network for Music Imagery Information Retrieval
## Intro
This project directory contains my pytorch CNN model, training scripts, preprocessing scripts, and data for my experiments on the OpenMIIR public EEG dataset. The OpenMIIR dataset contains electroencephalography recordings taken from nine participants listening to and imagining twelve well-known musical pieces. Of these twelve pieces, four are instrumental, four are lyrical, and the last four are lyrics-omitted versions of the four lyrical pieces. The goal of this project was to build and train a CNN model that could identify which of the musical pieces was being listened to from a given raw EEG data sample taken from a random participant.
