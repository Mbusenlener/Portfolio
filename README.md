# Intro
My name is Matthew Busenlener, and I am a third-year student at USC studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science with an emphasis in AI. This repository hosts my AI and SWE related personal projects.

# Projects
### AI Music Generator
* A transformer-based Pytorch model trained from scratch that generates original, polyphonic music from text descriptions.
* This model uses reversible layers and FAVOR+ attention to handle sequences up to 4500 tokens.

### EEG MIIR-Net (Music Imagery Information Retrieval) 
* A CNN model implemented in Pytorch for classifying raw EEG waveforms from the OpenMiir dataset of 9 participants listening to 8 different songs.
* This model is trained to predict which of the 8 songs an unseen participant is listening to based on high-resolution EEG recordings of the participant's brain activity.

### Trojan Housing Finder
* A full-stack web application built with React, SpringBoot, and MySQL allowing USC students to search, filter, and review available rental properties near campus.
